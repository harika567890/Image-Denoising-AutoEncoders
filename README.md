# Image-Denoising-AutoEncoders
Convolutional autoencoder project for image denoising using the MNIST dataset with Gaussian noise. Includes dataset preparation, model training, evaluation metrics (PSNR, SSIM), and visualizations of noisy, original, and denoised images. Demonstrates deep learning's effectiveness in image restoration.
